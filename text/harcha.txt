##### Ingredients:
- ###### 2 cups (350 grams) fine semolina (not durum flour)
- ###### 3 tablespoons sugar
- ###### 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ###### 1/4 teaspoon salt
- ###### 1/2 cup (125 grams) soft or melted unsalted butter
- ###### 1/2 to 3/4 cup (120 to 180 milliliters) milk
- ###### 1/4 cup coarse semolina, optional

##### Steps to Make It:

##### In a large bowl, blend together the fine semolina, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter, and blend with your hands or a wooden spoon just until the mixture is the consistency of sand and the semolina grains have all been moistened. 

##### Add 1/2 cup milk and mix until dough forms. It should be quite moist, wet almost, and easily packed into a large mound. Add additional milk if necessary to achieve this consistency.

##### Shape the dough into balls any size that you like and leave the dough to rest a few minutes.

##### Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. While the griddle is heating, roll the balls in the coarse semolina, if using, and flatten each ball into a disc about 1/4-inch thick, or a bit thicker if you like.

##### Cook the harcha over fairly low heat, about 5 to 10 minutes on each side, until they turn a pale to medium golden color. Flip only once, and check occasionally to be sure the harcha aren't coloring too quickly, as they need some time to cook all the way through.

##### Serve immediately with jam, cheese, or butter.
